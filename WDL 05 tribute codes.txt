        <p>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj (February 19, 1627 â€“ April 3, 1680)<br>
            Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan.<br>
            Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur 
            which formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire.<br>In 1674, he was formally crowned the Chhatrapati 
            of his realm at Raigad Fort.Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and 
            hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the Sultanate of Golkonda, Sultanate of Bijapur and the European 
            colonial powers. Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and 
            building forts, and forming a Maratha navy. Shivaji established a competent and progressive civil rule 
            with well-structured administrative organisations. He revived ancient Hindu political traditions, 
            court conventions and promoted the usage of the Marathi and Sanskrit languages, replacing Persian 
            in court and administration. Shivaji's legacy was to vary by observer and time, but nearly two centuries 
            after his death, he began to take on increased importance with the emergence of the Indian independence 
            movement, as many Indian nationalists elevated him as a proto-nationalist and hero of the Hindus.</p>
